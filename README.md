bo# Box Model Practice
---
_The purpose of this repository is to help you practice using margin, padding, and display._

## Directions
* Fork and clone this repository.
* Edit `style.css` by adding your own declarations _as indicated by the comments_.
* Your goal is to make the preview of `index.html` look similar to `result.png`.
* NOTE: Because exact values are not given, do not spend a long time doing guess-and-check.  Focus on 3 things:  
  * Get the black and yellow boxes centered.
  * Get the gray boxes to stack **next to** each other.
  * Get the boxes spaced out, but again, don't worry about exact values.
* Do not edit existing code.  Only add new declarations.
